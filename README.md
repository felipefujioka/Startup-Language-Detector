*Startup Language Detector*

This project has as main objective to be a 4 hours 2018 carnival project, nothing else, the usability and functionality of this app is totally not guaranteed and will never be. Any bug or complaint should be kept secret from its creator.

How to install
=======
Clone this repo:
`````
git clone <repo URL>
`````
Open Google Chrome and go to Window -> Extensions.  
Check the 'Developer mode' box.  
From the new menu that appears, select `Load unpacked extension...`.  
Browse to the root of the project repo and `Select` it.  
You are good to go.  

How to use this POC
=======
POC stands out for Piece Of ..... Code.  
The app can be accessed in the chrome tool bar, as a little SLD icon, in really bad chosen colors.  
First of all browse to a page that looks like a Startup email full of buzzwords , it's not that hard to find one, is it?  
*(Just brazillian portuguese is supported at the moment, because of reasons)*  
Click it and it will show a popup with **NO STYLING AT ALL**. Click in `Check page`.  
All buzzwords (accordingly with my personal opinion), will be highlighted.  
Tadaaaaaa! That's it.  

What is comming next?
======== 
* support a language not spoken just by third world countries
* give the page a rank of BKOA (Business Keywords Overuse Annoyance)
* make BKOA to turn into a BUK (Business Useless Keywork)
* make BUK to turn into a buzzword 

How to contribute
========
You can contribute by making a PR of words you wanted to see highlighted. To do so, just edit the list in `js/sl_detector_content.js`.  
You can try to make improvements in the code of this application, but I'm not likely to review this 4 hours code project, I know it is inneficient and not scalable... scalable is in the list if you asked yourself. I will accept the PR, if it is good and you annoys me enough to the point I review it.
